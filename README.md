# Scientific Project
This is a project performed as part of a module during my master studies.
## Description
The main objective of this project is to develop a design program in python
to calculate the requirements of implementing a geothermal power plant for residential
households. The program aims to calculate the area required for the heat exchangers and
select the characteristics of the heat pump to meet the demand of the building. Various
input parameters are to be considered and achieving maximum closeness to the real world
conditions are also targeted. Also, this program is indented to be simple and user friendly
so that common people can gain insights into the requirements of installing a ground
source heating, cooling and domestic water heating system.

## Program
###Type Selection
In this section the user selects the type of the heat exchanger. The window contains the title of the
program at the top along with the logo of the program. The text prompts the user to
select a type of heat exchanger. After selection the user should click on the Next button
to move on to the next page.
### Energy Demand Calculation
This stage involves the calculation of the energy demand required for the residential
building. The user is required to enter the area of the residential building to be heated.
Once the area is entered then the Calculate button becomes click-able and leads to the
calculation of the heat output. The user can move on to the next stage by clicking Next button or move to the previous stage
by using Back button.
### Pump Selection
In this stage the program selects a suitable pump depending on the heat demand required
by the building by looking through the data of a pump manufacturer. When the Display
Heat Pump button is clicked the characteristics of the selected heat pump is displayed.
### Heat Exchanger 
In the final stage of the program the user is required to provide more data to accurately
determine the output. The type of the soil of the construction area helps the program to decide on the specific abstraction capacity of the region. If the
user is unaware of the type of soil at the location, a helping weblink is provided below
the soil selection that redirects the user to the Thermomap website. This provides the
soil type and the soil properties. Then the user is required to choose the annual peak
load operation. In most cases it is 1800 hours per year but the program also provides
an alternate possibility for selection. The selection of both these parameters makes the
Calculate button clickable to proceed further.
#### Horizontal Heat Exchanger
In the case of horizontal heat exchanger the program calculates the area required for
the heat exchanger and the distance between the loops of pipes.
#### Vertical Heat Exchanger
In case of vertical heat exchanger the program calculates the length of the borehole
required to satisfy the demand. Also, in case of vertical heat exchanger it is required to
provide the number of boreholes that are being planned to be installed.
